# PokeStats: Pokemon Data Analysis ðŸ§¹ðŸ“ˆ

## About

This project analyzes Pokemon data using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
The goal is to clean the data, create new features like "Total Stats" and "Speed Category," and visualize key insights such as attack vs defense and speed distributions.

## Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Project description
```


## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Open `PokeCode.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. View the generated visualizations.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and duplicate removal
- Creating a "Total Stats" feature by summing major Pokemon characteristics
